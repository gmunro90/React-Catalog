# Zignaly Phone Catalog App

This project was designed as a simple product catalog app for a Frontend Developer interview process.

It is a basic app that displays a variety of phones, called from a mock API (json server). On the homepage, all phones are displayed. There are two sorting options available. These allow you to sort the phones by brand, or by price (low-high). When click 'details' on one phone, it renders a detailed page, providing in deph info, reviews, stock info etc on that particular phone.
